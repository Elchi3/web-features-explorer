# web-features explorer

A website to visualize the web platform data that's maintained in the [web-platform-dx/web-features](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/) repository in interesting ways, including a monthly release note.

The website: https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/

## Goal

* To visualize the web-features data.
* To provide a way to explore the data in user-friendly ways, such as:
  * By [baseline-low features](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/recent/) (newly available on the web platform).
  * By [baseline-high features](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/baseline/) (widely available on the web platform).
  * By [monthly release notes](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/monthly/).
  * Or, by features that are [not yet available](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/nobaseline/) on the web platform.
* To test various use cases that consumers of this data have.
* To detect issues in the data.

## Architecture

### Data

The data that the website is based on comes from the [web-features](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-features) npm package, by using its **next** version (which always provide the data from the latest commit on the web-features repo).

In addition, the [@mdn/browser-compat-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-compat-data) npm package is used to get various other pieces of information, such as links to MDN documentation and links to bug trackers.

To ensure you have the latest data:

1. Run `npx npm-check-updates -u`

1. Run `npm update web-features`

### Build

The website consists of static HTML pages and uses a build script to generate those HTML pages from the data.

The template files, from which the static HTML pages get generated, use the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static website generator. The template files are found in the `site` directory.

The result of the build script is found in the `docs` directory, which is the directory that GitHub Pages uses to serve the website (see [Deployment](#deployment)).

To re-generate the website, after updating the data:

1. Run `npm install`

1. Run `npm run build` to generate the site
   
   You can also run `npm run serve` to start a local server and watch for changes

### Deployment

The website is deployed to production using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The static HTML pages are generated on the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features-explorer/tree/gh-pages).

### Automatic updates

The website is automatically updated on every push to the main branch by using a GitHub Actions script found in `.github/workflows/generate-site.yaml`.

The dependencies are also automatically updated every day by using the GitHub Actions script in `.github/workflows/bump-deps.yaml`.
